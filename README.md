# Memory Game Project

This is a classical browser-based memory game with 16 cards, where you have to find the exact match of the cards.

## How to play

* click on a card and then on an other one
* if cards match they remain flipped over, if not they are turning back
* keep on searching for new matches and don't forget: there're only two cards shown at once, so have to have very good memory!
* once you have found all matches, a rating window appears and tells you your results, plus you can start a new game if you wish so
